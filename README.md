# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
-The purpose of this exercise was to replace potentially corrupt school testing data and rerun an analysis. Specifically, ninth grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School were ignored when conducting the analysis. 

## Results
-Overall, the results were not too significantly impacted by ignoring ninth grade scores from Thomas High School. This is because a) that sample accounted for a small portion of overall sample size, and b) the ninth grade scores were already relatively in line with overall scores at THS.

### How is the district summary affected?
-The overall math score dropped by 0.1. Other metrics are in line to the tenth decimal place.

### How is the school summary affected?
- % passing math, reading & overall are all down slightly for THS.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
-While THS's overall passing rate dropped slightly, it still has the second highest pass rate among all schools.

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade
-There are not meaningfully changed.

#### Scores by school spending
-The scores and passing rates for the THS bucket ($630-$644) all dropped slightly

#### Scores by school size
-There are not meaningfully changed.

#### Scores by school type
-There are not meaningfully changed.
